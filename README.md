# MiniEx2 - Steven with error

<b>Coding process:</b>
First when I opened Brackets I tried to put in some of the codes from p5.js' site.
They showed up in the browser as just the code instead of what the code should execute.
I could not make sense of what the p5.js site was telling me to do, so I contacted a programmer friend who could tell me what I did wrong.
What I was lacking was to put script and function setup into the code.
I also needed to put a file into the folder where I kept my save files from Brackets. The file was called p5.min, which was in the folder I downloaded on p5.js' site.
After inserting these codes I tested by creating a circle, and it successfully showed up in the browser.
Now that I had a chart I could begin creating my project.
At first I wanted to create a smiley that would follow the mouse, and temporarily turn into a red circle with a cross at random moments to signal that an error had occurred. 
I did succeed to insert an image of a smiley, but I could not have it follow the mouse, nor give it the right proportions.
My plan B became a stationary smiley that was cut in half. From then on I simply just had to find the right shapes in p5.js' reference archive and alter their appearance and position to my liking. I succeeded to create a smiley cut in half by using arcs and ellipses.

<b>What constitutes a program?:</b>
A program constitutes of the connection between commands and the execution of those commands. If I want to draw a circle I need to type a specific number of characters, because it has in advance been made so that these characters execute this circle.

<b>The notion of error:</b>
To me, an error can only be detected when I have an idea about what would have been the right outcome. When I click on a video on youtube and it shows noise in the video frame, it is an error because I know there was supposed to play a video. When I play a game and the human character is hovering above the ground, it is an error because I know that in real life humans is on the ground because of gravity, and the game is trying to simulate reality.
